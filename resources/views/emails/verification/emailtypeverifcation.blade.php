        You can now get customers to your business in minutes with Eventpad. Eventpad is not just a listing platform. We offer a request/reply form of communication 
        between you and those that need your services. They make a request, you reply with your quotes.
        <!--To complement your effort in getting new customers, Eventpad makes it possible for Individuals and Event Organizers to reach out to you when in need of your service. 
        This works by making requests from individuals and event organizers accessible to you. 
        You can then decide to respond to them provided you are interested in making them your customers-->
